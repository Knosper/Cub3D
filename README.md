# cub3D
My first RayCaster with MLX42

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 

# Notes:

- Only push when make is working without errors

# TODOs:

1. Map checks:
- 'data->map' is not perfect because it will not identify the end of the map and it saved all rest inside like empty lines etc.

2. Mlx:
- Need to set up keys for movement and settings, when map is rendered.
- Bonus stuff...

3. Edgecases:
- search and fix edgecases!
