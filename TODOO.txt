Data leaks:
-write a free function, (on every exit point? or is exit enough?)
Nuno - comment: when exiting the program it's not needed to call free. The OS will take care of freeing the memory used by the program.
JJ - Nice 

Map checks:
-If map is closed/surrounded with walls
-if One (only one) player is inside
-of course check if player is surrounded by valid objects!
- 'data->map' is not perect because it will not identify the end of the map and it saved all rest inside like empty lines etc.

Mlx:
-we have the skyline/background for the window, raycasting/drawing/rendering objects is next step
-textures are saved in struct data->textures[0] - data->textures[1] - data->textures[2] - data->textures[3]

-Need to set up keys for movement and settings, when map is rendered.
-Bonus stuff...

search and fix edgecases!
