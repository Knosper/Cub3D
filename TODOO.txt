Data leaks:
-write a free function, (on every exit point? or is exit enough?)
Nuno - comment: when exiting the program it's not needed to call free. The OS will take care of freeing the memory used by the program.

Treestructure:
-in main.c are functions which should be in other file/folder
-create the files add them to cub.h Makefile and so on

Map checks:
-If map is closed/surrounded with walls
-if One player is inside

Mlx:
-we have the skyline/background for the window, raycasting and drawing/rendering objects is next step

-Need to set up keys for movement and settings, when map is rendered.
-Bonus stuff...
