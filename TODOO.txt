Map checks:
- 'data->map' is not perect because it will not identify the end of the map and it saved all rest inside like empty lines etc.

Mlx:
-we have the skyline/background for the window, raycasting/drawing/rendering objects is next step
-textures are saved in struct data->textures[0] - data->textures[1] - data->textures[2] - data->textures[3]

-Need to set up keys for movement and settings, when map is rendered.
-Bonus stuff...
